# Bomberman Online

Bomberman Online is an educational project that implements an online Bomberman clone. The application consists of a client built with TypeScript and Phaser, and a server developed in Python using FastAPI.

> **Note:**  
> The spritesheets were obtained from [Spriters Resource](https://www.spriters-resource.com/nes/bomberman/) and the BetterVCR font from [Dafont](https://www.dafont.com/better-vcr.font). This project is for educational purposes only and is not intended for commercial use. Proper credit to the original rights holders is recommended.

## Getting Started

The project is organized into two main directories:

- **[bomberman-client](./bomberman-client/README.md):** Contains the client application (TypeScript/Phaser).
- **[bomberman-server](./bomberman-server/README.md):** Contains the server application (Python/FastAPI).

A `docker-compose.yml` file at the root of the project allows you to run both the client and server together with a single command:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

## Overview

A demonstration video is included in the repository â€“ please see the video below for a walkthrough of the project.

For more detailed information about each component, please refer to the individual README files in the `bomberman-client` and `bomberman-server` directories.

    - [x] __Feat__: Create a custom lobby to search a match usign username and room code
    - [x] __Refactor__: Refactoring of the Code for both thinking about the Modularization and Good Practices
    - [x] __Refactor__: Use of Modularization, Design Pattern and SOLID to improve the code separating big code with a lot of responsabilities in modules _(specially the GameScene.ts that was doing a lot of things)_
    - [x] __Feat__: Develop handlers to exchange informations between clients using the server _(websocket)_

##### Visual Improvements  _(Code)_
